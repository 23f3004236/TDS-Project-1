- **An explanation of how I scraped the data:** <br><br>
The code uses GitHub's API to scrape user profiles from Sydney with over 100 followers. It fetches user details (e.g., login, company, bio) and repositories, handling rate limits with time.sleep(). Data is saved into users.csv and repositories.csv after organizing and cleaning fields like company names and licenses.
   
- **The most interesting and surprising fact I found after analyzing the the data:** <br><br>
My analysis unveils a fascinating trend that Sydney developersâ€™ repositories with the MIT license and languages like Go and JavaScript attract the highest engagement.

- **An actionable recommendation for developers based on my analysis:**<br><br>
To maximize visibility and engagement, developers should license projects under MIT for its openness and consider coding in high-demand languages like Go and JavaScript. This combination not only attracts more contributors but also increases project appeal in the broader developer community.
